2024-05-07,1,"""left with a horrible back pain""",United Kingdom,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA doesn't seem to understand why its customers choose to fly with them over low-cost carriers like Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air and the keep racing to the bottom, despite never being cheap enough or comprehensive enough in terms of flights to certain destinations. They've installed the same appalling slimline seats easyJet and Wizz Air have, but managed to make them even more uncomfortable. They have no lumbar support, and also don't have headrests like BA's old Pinnacle seats. They also have no recline and despite being refurbished had no at seat charging either. My understanding was that seats upto row 12 should have the old Pinnacle seats, so I woke up early to check-in just as check-in opened on the app 24hrs before and was pleased to bag a seat in row 10 which should mean I have the old Pinnacle seat. Apparently not, at least not on BA Euroflyer their subsidiary at Gatwick, the whole plane had the new appalling slimline seats even in Business - I'd have been pretty appalled if I had paid extra to fly in that cabin and been left with that seat for 3hrs. They are probably ok for an 1 maybe 2hr flight max, but on a 3hr flight to Catania from Heathrow it was painful and we were left with a horrible back pain.",Economy Class,A320,3x3,April 2024,Couple Leisure,,,,,,1.0,1.0,no,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1
2023-05-08,1,"""economy seat masquerading as business class""",Australia,✅ Trip Verified |  Boeing 787-9 - not worth the money. The seats were extremely narrow so like lying in a coffin. When the seats were out (which is all the time on these long flights) you have to clamber over passengers to get to the toilet. The configuration of the cabin means that some one is always waking up someone else. This is an economy seat masquerading as a business class seat and is misleading and deceptive conduct because there is NO WAY you can get any rest if you book with British Airways.,Business Class,Boeing 787-9,2x3x2,May 2023,Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,,,,,,2

We had a 20 hour red eye flight LHR to SYD with a refuelling and quick crew change in SIN. Looks deceive. We were seated in row E (middle 2 of 4) centre aisle. Great, until the seat in front reclined and we discovered we were trapped. The seat arms are not retractable, (that is where the tray table is located). The distance between the arm rest and the fully reclined seat in front is under 7 inches. To extract yourself you have to wake 3 passengers, 2 in front to lift their seat backs to an upright position and the passenger to your side to allow you to lift your legs up over the arm rests. I found it impossible to watch my screen due to it being so far off vertical, it was sending me dizzy looking at it. One other problem I discovered, because I was stressed at being uncomfortable I started getting hot to find the Boeing 777 does not have individual air conditioning cold air nozzles, once the temperature is set it can’t be individually cooled.

The 1-2-1 configuration is a step up from their 2-3/4-2 configuration and the privacy on the seats is pretty good. The door isn't helpful and is more of a gimmick (could've been higher). The new IFE screens are way better than the older ones, they are more clear and bright and responsive than the old IFE screens. The seats on club suite are still fabric, which in my opinion, is better than leather and more comfortable. The seats now have convenient storage bins and power ports which is a very big improvement when compared to the old club world. The seats also have adjustable armrests which make sliding out of your seat during meal services easy. The service, in general, was fantastic and very similar to other BA flights I've had.

Luckily my seat did not have the IFE box under the seat in front as this robs passengers of further legroom. The recline was ok on the seat and the adjustable headrest could be quite comfortable if there was just another 2 inches of legroom. When the seat in front is reclined however the IFE screen is in your face. Choice of IFE was however very good. The headphone socket in the arm of the seat is very easily damaged due to the location and care is needed if the headphones are left plugged in when leaving your seat. I feel on any long haul flight the passengers in the window and center seat should be able to get out to use the bathroom without disturbing the other passengers in the row.

2019-05-31,3,"""The seat pitch is poor""",United Kingdom,"Not Verified |  Had booked with Japan Airlines unaware that our return flight was actually a codeshare with BA. On the outward JAL flight, the economy cabin seat pitch was decent so plenty of leg room. Also wherever they put the video boxes it wasn't under the seats so plenty of room to move your legs about under the seat. The return flight on BA (787) was a different story. The seat pitch is poor so my knees were practically touching the seat in front. Also, the boxes for the video are under a lot of the seats so a third of my meagre legroom under my seat was taken up by the video box. This makes for an extremely uncomfortable 12 hour flight and impossible to sleep as my legs jammed under the seat prevented me from reclining properly. JAL lets you book your seat when you make the booking.

Several storage bins available so you could store your personal items. The controls were easy to use and understand. The drawback to this isle seat is the lack of privacy. In BA 787 layout you get one or the other but not both- Privacy or direct isle access. So if this was the overnight flight I wouldn't want such open access to the isle as it would be harder to sleep as people passed by. If you are going to plan to sleep the long flight you might want a window or center seat as they are closed to foot traffic. The other odd thing about the BA layout is you are looking face to face with the person next to you, not a big deal in our case as I was seated next to my travel partner. I will say that like other 787 I've flown, the interior is looking worn and a bit beat up with obvious damage.

The seats are not to the latest standards in the industry. Seats feel tight and look tired and forget privacy. Passengers have no privacy except you have the window side seats as the dividers only provide little sense of privacy. But stepping over a passenger on the aisle seat is also not nice when the seat is flat. The IFE system is old with touch screen with poor quality screens which need to pressed really hard to make a selection. Further the content is not much or varied. The plus of flying BA Club World is just more legroom, not sitting in World Traveller or Premium Economy and more luggage allowance. BA Wifi is now also available. Otherwise I think BA Club World is  overpriced for what you get. It is not an amazing experience. The staff was attentive on the way to CPT but not at all on the way back to LGW.

The schedule was Manchester to Heathrow then Heathrow to Grand Cayman and return flights 14 days later so 8 seats in total. At the time of booking I checked emergency exit seats were available on all flights and all seats at emergency exits were available. I am 6’2” and anyone 6’ or over will know the discomfort experienced in a normal pitch seat. BA had prices on all seats so you could reserve the seat you wanted, the seats at the emergency exits where you could see there was more space for your legs were 3 times the price of a normal seat. I paid additional fees for 8 seats at emergency exits. I receive emails from BA in July 2018 to say they had changed my seating allocation but I presumed they had just moved us to another exit seat on a like for like basis. If not I was expecting a refund, the refund never came, so I remained confident we were still seated in a like for like basis. Out of 8 emergency exits seats I paid for, we were only seated in 3. Upon my return I requested a refund from BA for 5 seats I’d paid for at a premium rate, below is their response. Thanks for getting in touch with us about your flight from Manchester on 22 November. You’re clearly disappointed with your seat because it didn’t have as much leg room as you’d expected. I completely understand why you’re feeling let down. I realise you feel you didn't get the seats you'd paid for. The maps you can see on ba.com are representative of the seats on board our flights. We can’t guarantee your seat will be exactly as shown on our website, as the configuration can vary depending on the aircraft you’re travelling on. I’m afraid we can’t promise you’ll be able to sit in a particular seat on our aircraft and we do advise this in our General Conditions of Carriage, which you accept when you make your booking. This means I’m unable to offer you a refund on this occasion. I know this isn’t the answer you were hoping for and I’m sorry. I can see why you’re frustrated we didn’t meet your expectations and we’re grateful you've taken the time to let us know how you’re feeling. Thanks again for giving us the opportunity to respond to your concerns. We appreciate your support as a Blue member of our Executive Club. I hope we can welcome you on board again soon. Please feel free to contact me directly using the blue link below if I can help you with anything else. I emailed them back stating I’d paid a premium for extra leg room seats by emergency exits and I expected a refund and this was their reply. I'd like to inform you that we do inform passengers that the seat map is for guidance only and not true to scale. Extra space between rows does not indicate extra legroom. However, any exit row seat may have extra leg room, but we don't sell these seats as extra leg room seats on ba.com. The leg room may vary as per the aircraft seating configuration. I do appreciate your reasons for asking, I'm afraid we cannot refund you the prepaid seating charge. So basically, BA believe if they do not sell seats as extra legroom seats, they can charge you a premium for them, then move you to a seat you’d pay less for and not refund you the difference. The scale argument does not stand up to scrutiny as the seat pitch at emergency exits are more than standard pitch.",Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x3x3,December 2018,Couple Leisure,,,,,,,4.0,no,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,27

Crew offered me an extra pillow to seat on it, which didn't help either. The tv screen on 30B was also not working.

As far as perks go that was it. Food ran out so we ended up with economy food, nice but not fantastic. The back seat TV was old fashioned, small in size compared to other airlines and had a very limited choice, all in all both flights were very disappointing.

The seats had seen better days, and the whole cabin looked quite old and tatty. The screens on the back of the seats in front were tiny and quite difficult to see. In my case it was not functioning correctly anyway, but I'd brought my own entertainment so not really a problem. There was the - now usual - problem of people bringing up to five bags onboard, some of which were large suitcases, so very little room in the overhead lockers for those who'd only brought on one bag. Since our bags fitted under the seat in front this was not an issue. The biggest problem was the meal service. There were theoretically two meal options but since we were at the back of the cabin we were left with the option nobody else wanted: they called it ""spinach and ricotta ravioli"", but it was an inedible slab of dried up pasta and dried up tomato ketchup. On the plus side for us, the first choice, ""Fillet of beef with broccolini"", was also barely edible. In my experience economy gets much better meals than premium economy on most airlines. If travelling premium economy on British Airways, where one of the options is inedible slops, those at the back of the cabin will effectively get no meal because the travellers at the front get first choice. If you're travelling from London you can choose your meal beforehand, which is useful. If you're travelling to London at the back of the cabin bring your own meal with you or you may end up going hungry.",Premium Economy,Boeing 777-200,2x4x2,September 2018,Couple Leisure,,,,,,1.0,1.0,no,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,31

The control for the in flight entertainment is in the side of the seat so you regularly brush it just sitting in the seat which can turn the entertainment off or pause the video. The screen for the entertainment was amongst the smallest i have seen and much smaller than economy class on other aircraft types. The entertainment kept skipping and had to be reset just after take off which meant no entertainment access for 30 mins. The leg room pitch was pretty good. A lot of the blinds were broken in some way so a lot of light poured into the cabin and as this was an overnight 10 hr flight that was not idea. They need to refurbish these old 747s desperately. The seat power point in word traveller plus is the old empower connection. No one uses this connection type anymore. it needs to be changed. It's like having a car with a CD player.

As we made our way onto the plane (from near the front of the general boarding queue), my perfectly average not heavy not oversized bag (we also had checked baggage) was taken from me to be put in the hold. I don’t know why they selected me as they then allowed practically the rest of the plane to board with their bags. I didn’t have luggage locks - my wife had them and she had boarded in front of me - and when i got on board my wife became upset because her jacket with her wallet had been in my bag because we couldn’t carry everything. She told a surly stewardess with dark hair who couldn’t have cared less. My wife questioned why my bag was taken when people with more luggage than us we being let on and the plane wasn’t completely full and she just said they’re wasn’t enough locker space. Why penalise those who arrive early at the check in then?? We’ve had stuff stolen from hand luggage placed in the BA hold before - which we mentioned to zero interest from the staff. The surly woman then proceeded to bang into my wife throughout the flight as she marched her M&S laden trolley up and down, touting the expansive tat you can buy for much less on the ground. The payment system now means those on the aisle are stuck with someone’s rear end in their faces for much longer as purchases are made, plus trolleys left in the aisle while something is heated up in the galley and trotted back out. The bags that were placed in the hold appeared very last at the baggage claim, adding to our stress. Luckily the wallet was untouched. We fly business as a family numerous times to Australia each year and we never choose BA because of the generally rubbish service on short haul flights. I'd rather spend the big bucks where I can be guaranteed good service (Singapore etc).

Finally, the galley serving other classes on the upper deck is located directly behind the small economy section and the food preparation smells are oppressive.

The aircraft was dirty with a thick layer of dust between the window seat and the cabin wall. There were cup ring marks on the arms and the seats were the most uncomfortable I think I have sat on for a long flight of nearly 9 hours in any class including economy. The cushion area was devoid of any 'cushioning' and the seats were worn and old looking. The TV had a screen not much bigger than my mobile and the quality was so poor I decided that I would use my phone and listen to the music for the entire trip home. This is the first time I have ever felt that I could not tolerate the poor screen quality. I had to wear my glasses just to try and follow the on screen commands. The only positive was that the earphones provided worked well on my phone and the noise cancelling removed most of the inflight noise. At a time when BA seem to be moving away from their prestige airline image that has been their selling point for many years I really can not understand why customers travelling long distances should have to be transported in such awful planes. My only serious satisfaction is that I did not accept the offer to upgrade to business. First of all the price offered was too much and secondly when I checked out the business class it did not look in anyway inviting.

Legroom has been reduced too. On the outward flight we had no video either. No value for money. I would strongly recommend budget airlines where tickets cost considerably less and one may bring their own meal-deal on board or local airlines where for the same price-range as BA one is served drinks with snacks, a hot meal followed by tea or coffee.

There are some other airlines also charge for seat selection, but normally they are low cost carriers. British Airways charges premium fees for its seats and is a national carrier. This is pure greed. If you don't take a checked in bag, you are saving BA money. So why should they punish you in return? They save time/money on loading the plane - on staff at the check in desk - on downtime at the gate - on risk due to terror hype - on paying to replace lost baggage and  belongings and on fuel due to less weight etc. They should reduce the ticket price, not increase it!

As for entertainment, if you can actually see the picture on the SatNav sized screens then you're a better person than me. British Airways is currently offering a premium product in cost, but is actually providing a mediocre one in reality.

The crew made some checks and informed us that the problem could not be fixed. For the next 10 hrs, the affected passengers just had to endure the situation.

2015-01-27,7,British Airways customer review,United Kingdom,Seats 12A & 12B are the best seats in the cabin then 11J & 11K as they are bulkhead seats and you have the benefit of nobody reclining a seat in front of you both sets of seats give more legroom but 12AB give the most 12A and 11K are infant bassinet positions so these are not usually available to reserve until 24 hours before departure unless you are travelling with an infant. The AB side of the aircraft are served first for everything so you have a better chance of getting the meal of your choice on that side of the aircraft rather than the JK side. All seats are much much better than normal economy and definitely worth paying the extra for the premium ecnomy (world travelller plus as BA call it) especially if you can get seats in the pairs of AB/JK rather than the 4 in the middle.

These seats are really uncompetitive when compared to the new WTP seats on BA's A380s and some 777s and Virgin Atlantic's Premium Economy seats. While I was happy with legroom and access to aisles the seats are hard cramped and rather uncomfortable. BA have no plans to upgrade this cabin as they slowly retire their large 747 fleet.

2014-10-27,7,British Airways customer review,United States,"We were in WT+ seats 23 A and B from LHR to SEA. On this 777-300 we had the ""new"" World Traveler Plus seats. The seats are a step up from the shabby WT+ seats on the 747-400 we had on our outbound flight. The seats were ""slimline"" with very little seat padding and poor lumbar support. Probably the best feature of the new WT+ seat is the larger AVOD monitor built into the back of the seat in front. The new AVOD system is far superior especially the moving map function. There is a foot rest that drops down from the seat in front; it's nice but doesn't add much to the experience. Lavs (just two of them one on each aisle) are located just aft of the WT+ cabin and are shared with the main WT cabin; otherwise you have to hike back to the very rear to make use of the lavs there. Like other BA long-haul aircraft the 777-300 does not have passenger air vents above the seats in WT or WT+. Because the cabin temperature is kept at near-sauna levels the lack of vents can make the trip very very uncomfortable. Perhaps the biggest shortcoming is that leg-room is restricted by two metal equipment boxes under the seats in front. The boxes restricted the ability to stretch legs and effectively prevented storing any carry-ons under the seat in front. While the new WT+ has its short-comings it is still far superior to anything offered by US carriers as a premium economy product. For us the positives were worth the cost belong regular WT and in any event the cost of WT+ was far less than what we would have paid for Club World.",Premium Economy,BOEING 777-300ER,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,138
2014-10-27,6,British Airways customer review,United States,"We flew SEA-LHR on an aging 747-400 in World Traveler Plus seats 29 J and K near the 3R door. BA boards WT+ dead last. The seats were the old WT+ and showed their age in all respects (worn dirty etc); the AVOD monitor for seat 29J was so badly scratched and smeared that it was difficult to watch anything. The cabin was unbearably warm; be aware that BA's long-haul fleet evidently do not have seat air vents - so no way to keep cool. Seat 29K has no seat in front of it which makes leg room excellent and also allows for easy access to and from the seat to the aisle and area around the exit door. Seat width is poor and the seat has function buttons (and AVOD controls) on the inside of the arm rest making access and use very difficult. While it's true that the cost of WT+ is far less than the cost of Club World there is a big difference in seat comfort and the ability to get any real rest/sleep. On the other hand WT+ is far superior to what US airlines offer as their premium economy product (e.g. Delta ""economy comfort"" on its 767-300 on the same SEA to LHR route).",Premium Economy,BOEING 747-400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,138
2014-10-27,1,British Airways customer review,United Kingdom,This had to be the most uncomfortable flight in the world we flew American airlines LHR-MIA 777-300er and the seats were comfy and the flight entertainment worked. On the way back we flew BA from MIA-LHR and it was really bad I do not recommend sitting in row 33-36 as the leg room is reduced and the seats are uncomfortable I had a headphone set that didn't work and a box under the seat in front of me so I didn't have any leg room for my left foot now me being 6ft something and as a 15 year old teenager who likes a bit of leg room found it difficult to find some. I had flown from PLS-MIA before that flight to LHR but couldn't get any sleep because of the most uncomfortable chairs.

2014-10-27,4,British Airways customer review,United Kingdom,I am a seasoned business traveller and on long haul flights I tend to use Premium economy if available. Usually the extra cost is about £500 and I try to use points and money to further upgrade but that is usually a lottery and not often successful. I followed a similar procedure with a BA flight form LHR to JNB on an A380 and was in premium economy on the upper deck at the front bulkhead so leg room was not a problem but the seat itself was very disappointing compared to other BA flights I have been on in essence it was a an economy seat with more leg room and a worse than useless leg rest which did not come up far enough to support your legs comfortably. In addition BA are missing a trick as these 7 bulkhead seats could have a small food rest attached to the bulkhead so you could stretch your legs out completely. A further premium could be charged I am sure not dissimilar to the practise of many airlines. In future on this route I will save my money and fly economy as I did not see a £500 premium in the seat £300 tops.

It is an improvement on coach in terms of legroom and seat comfort the cabin service is more personal and although the food and drink is the same it is served with cloth serviettes and steel cutlery. (How do they get steel knives through security?) The main benefit though is that there were lots of empty seats while coach on this flight from CPT to LHR was full. The biggest let-down is the tiny low-res TV screen. One factor in favour of coach is that the hand-rests fold back so that if you're lucky enough to be the sole passenger in a row of 3 or 4 you can lie across the seats and enjoy a business class standard lie-flat bed.

Example - the passageway going aft to the toilets was blocked by crew dealing with a sick economy passenger one cabin crew let PE passengers go forward into the Business class cabin for the toilet another actually shouted at PE passengers for doing the same.

There was so much more leg room that I was comfortably able to stretch me bad knee out. The seat felt a bit wider too. I believe the food was the same that's served in Economy which on BA is pretty tasty. The only difference was that they came around with a basket of warm rolls tastier than the freezing cold ones you usually get. At the beginning of the flight they gave out warm damp hand towels very refreshing. Only problem was the couple in front of me reclined their seats all the way back the minute that they sat down. The person's head was basically in my lap. Unbelievable rude. I had to ask the flight attendant to request that they raise their seat during meal service or I wouldn't have been able to eat.

2013-01-01,7,British Airways customer review,United Kingdom,LHR-JFK-LHR. Outbound flight my wife and I were stuck with two seats on the left of a four seater in the middle of Economy - not great and leg room was poor (especially when seat in front reclined). On return sector selected two seats together during online check-in at the rear of Economy where the aircraft narrows - meaning the configuration switches from 3x4x3 to 2x4x2. Much more legroom and plenty of storage space - plus decent accessibility. Generally the seats on the BA 747s are reasonably comfortable and have a clever adjustable headrest which provides good neck support. The seats are not the new slim-line versions used by other carriers and so have decent padding. Definitely adequate for a 7 hour flight - but am sure on long flights to HKG SIN SYD or NRT discomfort could become an issue. Both B747s we traveled on must have been over 15 years old but in good shape - clean cabin and toilets etc. No issues with food and service was good (although an observation - BA don't tend to station cabin crew in the Economy cabin during boarding to assist passengers with luggage / finding seats etc - unlike Middle-Eastern / Asian carriers). Only real issues were overcrowding at BA's Terminal 7 as JFK and the IFE screen very small. BA charge a extortionate amount to pre-book seats prior to online check in opening. Best advice is to just complete online check-in early to ensure best seat selection.,Economy Class,BOEING 747-400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,173
2013-01-01,5,British Airways customer review,United Kingdom,Seats looked dated thin and not much leg room either. I was lucky to get a exit seat into the flight so was a bit more happy.,Economy Class,BOEING 747-400,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,no,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,174
2011-09-19,1,British Airways customer review,Australia,The price paid for Traveller Plus is not worth it as the seat width is very poor for the larger person. Power is only for laptop; not c-pap machine as quoted. Solid sided seats with controls on inside of seat and meal tray coming out of arm rest is suitable for small people only. Premium economy is only say 3 points better than economy where Club Class is way ahead.,Premium Economy,Boeing 777-200,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,175
2011-09-05,4,British Airways customer review,South Africa,BA for some weird reason insist on using these old planes on the Cape Town to London route preferring to use new planes on the Johannesburg route. We chose the World Traveller Plus product because it is a more spacious seat with a little more recline. But having flown it a few times I have decided that it is not worth the extra money. I'd rather fly economy and save my money for a decent hotel room for a few nights. Why does BA insist on using the old seats and old AVOD system with small screens?,Premium Economy,Boeing 747-400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,176

2011-05-14,7,British Airways customer review,United Kingdom,Exit row seat on a short haul configured 767. These planes are now very old but are much better than the usual single aisle. The seat was a rather old fabric covered one but was decent. The leather seats in the front half of economy are better though. Excellent leg room due to the exit row.,Economy Class,B767-300,2x3x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,178
2011-05-11,3,British Airways customer review,United Kingdom,I would pay the extra for premium economy on long haul (but not on BA again) because the alternative is unthinkable. BA's Premium Economy offer on 747s is very poor. The seats were shabby and dilapidated. Access to the light and call buttons was difficult because the are on the inside of the armrest in a narrow seat. The recline was poor and the screen was small (but good choice of films). Everything else - check in food beverages (including some particularly poor white wine) was standard Economy class . TheB 777's apparently have a newer version of premium economy but BA needs to up it's game if it wants to win customers.,Premium Economy,Boeing747 - 400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,179
2010-09-21,4,British Airways customer review,Australia,In premium Economy the seat pan was too small and the front of the seat cushion finished half way up my thigh. This cut off the circulation to my legs and made the extendable lower-leg rest totally useless. I am only 6 feet tall so not abnormal!,World Traveller Plus,B777,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,180
2010-02-03,8,British Airways customer review,United Kingdom,WTP London - Orlando. WTP is a big improvement over standard economy but the bigger seat is all you get. The rest of the service is the same as World Traveller. You even have to use the WT toilets. The seat itself is excellent and in my opinion worth paying the extra but BA could add something to make the WTP experience a little special given the price. I would fly BA WTP again but I might try Virgin Premium Economy next time.,World Traveller Plus,B777,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,181
2009-10-14,7,British Airways customer review,United States,"BA has typical 31"" pitch in World Traveller so it's a bit cramped. I like aisle on long hauls for easy access.

2009-09-20,4,British Airways customer review,United States,The seat itself was not bad except for being dirty however the IFE was broken for approximately 30-40 people in economy.

2009-02-07,8,British Airways customer review,United States,"I used to find that British Airways WT seats had very little leg room but this seems to have improved. The seat was comfortable for a 6'00"" guy on a 10.5 hour flight from LHR to SFO. I slept a bit on a day flight and had a good view of the screen (which had a lot of movie and TV choices)",Economy Class,B747-400,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,yes,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,185
2009-01-06,7,British Airways customer review,United Kingdom,Travelled WT+ and WT on BA on Toronto flights. The seats in WT+ are comfortable and recline well. It is difficult to judge legroom as we were in a cot position on both flights. In terms of comfort WT+ has the edge over WT as we found the seats harder in WT and more difficult to get comfortable which don't help on an 8 hour overnight flight.,World Traveller Plus,B777,2x3x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,186
2008-12-24,6,British Airways customer review,United Kingdom,World Traveller Plus cabin. Isle seat next to window seat has restricted foot space due to entertainment electronics under seat in front so swapped for window. Not a bad seat and fine for daytime long haul flights. But sleeping less good. Width feels less than Virgin and Qantas premium economy seats - BA fits the same number across a 777 as the others have in a 747. No AVOD and screen is incredibly small by today's standards. Power socket is low voltage type. Looking old.,Economy Class,B777,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,187
2008-09-19,6,British Airways customer review,Norway,Euro Traveller OSL-LHR. After flying a lot of low-cost airlines this was a good experience. I had seat 6F with the middle seat empty.

2008-08-17,6,British Airways customer review,South Africa,LHR-NBO The flight was not full and there were plenty of free seats so I had a row of three to myself.

2008-08-13,7,British Airways customer review,Ireland,9 hour flight from LGW to Orlando on outbound and 7 hours on the way back. Flight was comfortable although as always a little extra legroom in economy would go a long way to enhancing the economy flying experience. Flight out was longer but felt more comfortable on way back sat in row 22A on outbound and 21D on return. IFE was sufficient and kept me occupied!,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x3x3,,,,,,,,,,yes,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,190
2008-08-11,1,British Airways customer review,United Kingdom,Seat was very tight on width and i am 6ft with a 34inch waist. Space was okay when forward seat was not reclined but when it was it felt very close and you could not read or use you table. In flight entertainment wasn't fully working either and they made no announcement about this. Seat head rest were poor.,Economy Class,Boeing 747-400,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,no,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,191
